		<p style="color: #663366"> On 24 July 2020, my friends and I join Kelantan Red Crescent Society (Vad2), going to Lata Kolam Air Deru Ecopark in Jerteh, Terengganu. There, we do various activities such as water rescue activities, pitching tents, cooking, night walks and many more. Besides, I also learned how to rescue people that involved in accidents and disasters before they are taken to the hospital. The camp very interesting and fun. I gain new knowledge and experience when I join this camping.</p>

		<p style="color: #663366"> Then, on 16 September 2020, I also join Kelantan Red Crescent Society "Kembara Mesra Kemanusiaan". This is cycling activity that start from Stadium Sultan Muhammad IV to the Irama Bachock Beach. It was so exciting because I have never cycled that far in my life. But I'm not finishing it to the Irama Bachok Beach because I was numb and almost fainted. But it was the most unforgettable experience in my life. after I got home that day, I feel that my body was numb but I'm happy 'cause I can experience something like that.</p>
